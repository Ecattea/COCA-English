# Overview   
- The **Anki English Vocabulary Deck** published in this repository is designed to help learners acquire English entirely in an English context.   
- All prompts, definitions, and example sentences are written in English, helping you train reading and listening skills while memorizing vocabulary.   
- Decks follow the principle of atomicity: **each card contains only one sense or usage of a single entry, accompanied by example sentences and corresponding audio**.   
- This minimal-unit design significantly reduces cognitive load, improves memorization efficiency, and makes it easy to relearn or edit individual senses when needed.

## Recommended Study Philosophy
❗ **Don’t memorise the full definition.**  
Use each card in a “guess → check → refine” cycle:
1. **Front side:** Read the example sentence(s) and infer the word’s meaning from context.  
2. **Back side:** Reveal the concise definition and compare it with your guess.  
   - If they match, great—move on.  
   - If they differ, reread the sentence and note which contextual clues you overlooked.  
3. **Goal:** Recognise and understand the word in real-world use; precise recitation of the dictionary wording is unnecessary.

# Features   
## Corpus-driven Vocabulary Ordering ([COCA](https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/))   
- **Data Source:** Cards are ordered by frequency in the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) from highest to lowest. COCA contains over one billion words across eight genres (blogs, general web pages, movie transcripts, spoken interviews, fiction, magazines, newspapers, academic writing), ensuring modernity and diversity in frequency data.   
- **Lemmatization:** Forms such as *decide / decides / decided* are merged into a single lemma in COCA statistics, avoiding repetitive exposure to similar forms in early stages.   
- **Scope:** The current version includes the top 5,000 high-frequency lemmas.   
   
> Future Plan: I intend to purchase additional data licenses to expand the scope to 60,000 lemmas, providing broader advancement space for advanced and translation-focused learners.   
  
## Expert and Learner-friendly Definitions (Merriam-Webster's Learner's Dictionary with Audio)   
- **Target Audience:** This dictionary is perfect for ESL, EFL, ELL, and TEFL learners, offering concise yet precise definitions.   
- **Coverage:** Nearly 100,000 words and phrases, with 3,000 core vocabulary items specially marked for priority learning.   
- **Example Sentences:** Over 160,000 contemporary examples covering spoken and written contexts; 22,000+ idioms, collocations, and fixed expressions to enhance authentic usage.   
- **Consistency:** Unified formatting and labeling ensure a consistent style across cards, facilitating bulk editing and filtering.   
   
## High-fidelity Audio Support   
- **Word Pronunciation:** Native-speaker recordings from Merriam-Webster ensure quality and accurate phonetic alignment.   
- **Sentence Reading:** High-quality TTS synthesis with manually adjusted pacing, stress, and intonation, ideal for shadowing and listening practice.   
- **Dual-track Audio:** Separate audio for word and example sentence, allowing focused listening or full sentence practice.
